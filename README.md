# üè† Airbnb Clone Project

## üìò Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive backend system designed to simulate the architecture and functionality of the real Airbnb platform.  
It focuses on backend development, database design, API implementation, and CI/CD automation ‚Äî providing hands-on experience in building a scalable and secure real-world application.

---

## üéØ Project Goals
- Develop a backend architecture that supports scalable user and property management.  
- Understand end-to-end software development lifecycles ‚Äî from database design to deployment.  
- Implement secure APIs and CI/CD pipelines for real-world readiness.  
- Collaborate effectively using Git and GitHub version control workflows.  

---

## üß∞ Hands-on GitHub Repository Management
Learn how to **initialize, structure, and manage** a GitHub repository following industry best practices.  
This includes:
- Maintaining clear commit history and meaningful commit messages.  
- Structuring project folders logically (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `docs/`, etc.).  
- Using feature branches and pull requests to ensure clean, collaborative workflows.

## üë• Team Roles and Responsibilities
Each team member plays a critical role in ensuring project success:

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Backend Developer** | Builds the API, manages authentication, and ensures system scalability. |
| **Database Administrator (DBA)** | Designs and optimizes relational databases for performance and data integrity. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Implements CI/CD pipelines and manages automated testing and deployment. |
| **Security Engineer** | Ensures secure data flow, authentication, and protection from vulnerabilities. |
| **Project Manager** | Oversees timeline, task allocation, and coordination between technical roles. |

---

## üß± Technology Stack Breakdown

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **Django (Python)** | Backend framework for building RESTful APIs and handling business logic. |
| **MySQL / PostgreSQL** | Relational database systems for structured data management. |
| **GraphQL** | Query language for efficient and flexible API communication. |
| **Docker** | Containerization tool for consistent application deployment. |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD automation for testing and deployment pipelines. |
| **Nginx / Gunicorn** | Reverse proxy and WSGI server for hosting the application. |

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design Overview
The project‚Äôs database is modeled around core entities and their relationships:

| Entity | Key Fields | Relationships |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **User** | `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role` | A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings. |
| **Property** | `id`, `title`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `owner_id` | A property belongs to one user (owner). |
| **Booking** | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status` | A booking is linked to both a user and a property. |
| **Review** | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment` | A review connects users and properties they have booked. |
| **Payment** | `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `transaction_id` | Each payment corresponds to a single booking. |

Relationships:
- One **User** ‚Üí Many **Properties**
- One **Property** ‚Üí Many **Bookings**
- One **Booking** ‚Üí One **Payment**
- One **User** ‚Üí Many **Reviews**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Breakdown

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **User Management** | Registration, login, authentication, and role-based access control. |
| **Property Management** | CRUD operations for property listings, with image and location support. |
| **Booking System** | Enables users to reserve properties, check availability, and manage reservations. |
| **Review System** | Allows guests to post and view feedback on properties. |
| **Payment Integration** | Handles secure payment processing and verification. |
| **Admin Dashboard** | Provides analytics and management tools for admins and hosts. |

## üîê API Security Fundamentals
Security is at the core of the project. The following principles are applied:

| Security Measure | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Ensures that only verified users can access protected endpoints. |
| **Token-based Access (JWT/OAuth)** | Provides secure, session-less user authentication. |
| **Input Validation & Sanitization** | Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks. |
| **HTTPS Enforcement** | Protects data in transit. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Prevents brute-force or DDoS attacks. |
| **Secure Payment Flows** | Ensures sensitive data (cards, transactions) are protected. |

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) improve development efficiency and reliability:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
  Automatically tests and validates code after each push using **GitHub Actions**.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**  
  Uses **Docker** and **GitHub Actions** to build, test, and deploy to production environments automatically.

**Tools Used:**
- GitHub Actions (build/test/deploy automation)  
- Docker (containerization)  
- Nginx (reverse proxy and load balancing)  
- AWS / Render / Heroku (deployment environments)

---

## üß© Conclusion
This project is not just about coding but about mastering the **engineering mindset** ‚Äî collaboration, security, scalability, and automation.  
By completing it, contributors gain end-to-end backend experience aligned with modern industry standards.
